## Installation

**Before you get started** make sure you give full disk access permission to your terminal (for writing macos defaults). `System Preferences -> Privacy -> Full Disk Access`.

To install:

- clone this repo
- run `install.sh`
    - this install script will create some directories, download lots of software (via brew), set custom mac preferences, and symlink all dotfiles (via stow). Please refer to source code to see exactly what it does.

The install script will also setup Python and Node versions/environments:

-   [nvm](https://github.com/tj/n) sets the global Node version to LTS

### Customization

####  Git
- Be sure to update the user name/email values in the global [gitconfig](./git/.gitconfig)
#### Color Schemes

- Alacritty color scheme is [Snazzy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/terminal-snazzy)
- VSCode/Vim color scheme is [Ayu](https://github.com/dempfi/ayu)
-   The macOS ['highlight color'](https://github.com/gretzky/dotfiles/blob/main/macos/.macos#L22-L23) (accent color for mac, typically blue) is set to pink. To set it to a different color:
    -   Pick your desired color and get its RGB value (ex. pink is `255,105,180`)
    -   Take each value and divide it by 255 (ex. pink is now `1, 0.41176470588, 0.70588235294`)
    -   Put them into RGB order (ex. pink is `"1 0.41176470588 0.70588235294"`)
