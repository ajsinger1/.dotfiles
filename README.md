## Installation

**Before you get started** make sure you give full disk access permission to your terminal (for writing macos defaults). `System Preferences -> Privacy -> Full Disk Access`.

To install:

- clone this repo
- run `install.sh`
    - this install script will create some directories, download lots of software (via brew), set custom mac preferences, setup python, node, and ruby environment managers, and symlink all dotfiles (via stow). Please refer to source code to see exactly what it does. This script is not well tuned at the moment and I'm probably not going to fix it until I need to set up another laptop, you may need to run it multiple times for things to first get installed and properly loaded into the shell before.
